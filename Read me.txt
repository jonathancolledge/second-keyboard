In short, run set_up.bat (when prompted, accept admin permission and install AutoHotkey in "C:\Program Files\"), and then edit the scripts of LuaMacros and AutoHotKey without modifing their file name. They can be found inside LuaMacros and AutoHotkeyPortable folders.

NOTE. Lua Macros and AutoHotkey are open source, I have no responsability over their code and programs. Also, I am not a professional developer, I have no responsability over the use of this tutorial or the code I provide.
